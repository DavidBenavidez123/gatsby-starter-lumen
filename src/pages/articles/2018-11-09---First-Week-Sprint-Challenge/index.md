##Part 1 - Individual Accomplishments this Week
Paste your team’s github contribution graph here and indicate your Github Handle:
https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Labs8-RateMyDIY/graphs/contributors
Provide a paragraph (5-8 sentences) summarizing the work you did this week, the challenges you faced, the tools you used, and your accomplishments

The first 2 days were a bit slow for the entire group. The first day and half of the second day was helping getting Auth0 set up so that took a lot of time and I wasn't really able to "work" on anything. But for the other 2 days I worked on the front end and a bit of back end. I helped set up the components with redux so they would be ready to be used, when the endpoints were finished. And a made a dummy backend to pass in some data to have the reduces and actions ready for the endpoints and so I can work on styling.

##Tasks Pulled
List the tasks you pulled this week, and provide a link to the successfully merged PR completing that task and the trello card for that task.  You must have at least one front end and one back end. The expected total is 6 with a minimum of 4.

##Detailed Analysis
Pick one of your tickets and provide a detailed analysis of the work you did.  This should be approximately ¼ page of text, and at least three screenshots.

One of the tickets I worked on was to work on the Project list and the Review List for the front end. I was going to start styling the page but I needed data to be displayed because each item was going to be a little box that was going to display a project and each one was gonna be able to be clicked on. I set up the reducers and actions to where it would be exactly the same if we were to have the endpoints ready. So then I made a dummy backend with some static data and some endpoints so I can display the projects onto the 2 components. I was now able to style the pages since I had static data being passed through I was able able to mimic actual endpoints being used.

##Part 2 - Milestone Reflections
Put your response to the weekly question and a link to your team journal assignment here.


#As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your experiences forming a team. What did you do to help the team solidify as a group? What did you do that you now realize caused friction in this process?

Well my experience on forming this team went pretty well, We were already on the same page since day 1. We all discussed the stack that we were going to use , we all agreed on that. We discussed how we are going to start the project and what steps were needed to take first. It was just slow in the beginning because we were trying to learn something new but it worked out in the end.


##As a group, provide links to evidence that:

##Front end is deployed with a recognizable name. The site can be visited and will load a simple message
https://5be4dbe61f12b738826944b3--ratemydiy.netlify.com/

##Back end is deployed with a recognizable name. The address can be visited and will return data
https://ratemydiy-backend.herokuapp.com/

##User accounts are created: Either through a tool, or the front end, a user account can be created and signed in.
