Provide a paragraph (5-8 sentences) summarizing the work you did this week, the challenges you faced, the tools you used, and your accomplishments

I worked on letting the user being able to upload a picture through aws, having a search query letting users choose what catergories they want to load and currently still working on letting a user upload either 1 category or upload multiple categories. All of these things I have never worked on before so Learning how to do all of this was a struggle on it's own.

##Detailed Analysis
Pick one of your tickets and provide a detailed analysis of the work you did.  This should be approximately ¼ page of text, and at least three screenshots.

One of thet tickets that I worked on was letting a user upload an image with using aws. The reason we used aws was because we needed a service to let us upload images and store it. It was difficult at first but I found a way to do it. First I needed to let the user to upload an image to aws. Then in the response, It returns a location of the image and with that, I was able to send the url to the backend and then the image would be displayed in the front end.

##Part 2 - Milestone Reflections
Put your response to the weekly question and a link to your team journal assignment here.


#As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your experiences working with a team to convert a disparate set of components into a single, cohesive, and complete product. Describe the challenges you faced and the steps you took to overcome them.

We sort of have a complete projects but the problem with our feautures, we constantly need one feature to be done before we ever get to work on another. Our features are really dependent of eachother so that is something that we are trying to deal with. But currently we have most of our major features.


##As a group, provide links to evidence that:

##Front and back end servers are connected
https://5be4dbe61f12b738826944b3--ratemydiy.netlify.com/

##Users can create accounts and log in through the front end via OAuth
https://ratemydiy-backend.herokuapp.com/

##All APIs and services are connected and can be interacted with through the front end. A test message is acceptable to meet this requirement
