Provide a paragraph (5-8 sentences) summarizing the work you did this week, the challenges you faced, the tools you used, and your accomplishments

The work that I did this week was mostly just styling. We have most of our functionality done. It was pretty straight forward since I only worked on styling but I did get to implement a 3rd party libary, Material-ui and It helped make our project look alot more professional.

##Detailed Analysis
Pick one of your tickets and provide a detailed analysis of the work you did.  This should be approximately ¼ page of text, and at least three screenshots.

For this ticket, I was working on the landing page and search page styling the project tiles and user tiles. I had looked into other libraries for styling and one that caught my attention was material-ui. Design wise, it was very similar to how google styles everything so it looked very nice and neat. And the way you need to style the card is with css in js so that was something to get use to.

##Part 2 - Milestone Reflections
Put your response to the weekly question and a link to your team journal assignment here.


#As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your experiences working with a team to make your product look and feel as good as it works under the hood. Describe how the duties of you and your team shifted tasks shifted towards the front end - and debugging the back end to improve UX.

Working on the UX wasn't as hard as we initially thought it was going to be, we all already had a good sense of how we wanted the website to feel and function. There was alot of debugging and fixing in the backend and we just fixed whatever needed to be fixed in the front end.


##As a group, provide documentation of your progress and remaining tasks:

Link to each page and describe any remaining bugs, fixes, or tasks that need to be completed on that page
Minor bugs or quirks are expected, as documented in your writeup. Your PM will review your site to confirm that it has:

Consistent UI
Appropriate color scheme
Few console errors or warnings
Error handling for expected user interaction cases
Load speeds are reasonable
