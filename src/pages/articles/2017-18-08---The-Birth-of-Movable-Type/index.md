Provide a paragraph (5-8 sentences) summarizing the work you did this week, the challenges you faced, the tools you used, and your accomplishments

The work I was invloved this week was more engaging compared to last week. Last week was a lot of setting and figuring out what we were going to do but this week we had more of a clear goal already set, on what we were going to work on. I set up review modals for the projects on the landing page which I used react-strap and it was something i never used before so it was pretty cool implementing that and I also helped Michael with setting up AWS since we are going to be using that for our images and I set up a SMS api , Twillio, and that was also fun implementing since. This whole week was just working on new things that I haven't worked on before.

##Detailed Analysis
Pick one of your tickets and provide a detailed analysis of the work you did.  This should be approximately ¼ page of text, and at least three screenshots.

One of the tickets that I worked was to make a review modal for the projects. I had no clue how to even make a modal because during the front-end project week I couldn't even implement one, but I really wanted to learn so I took up the challenge. I used several resources on how to make a modal but a lot of them were either too complicated, hacky, or just didn't fit with what I wanted to do. I remember my old pm telling us to just use reactstrap and that would make our lives easier with making the modal and it did. Other modals required you to make another component and import to the component you wanted to have the modal in but with react strap you were able to implement the modal on the same page. There were some little gotchas that I had to figure out on my own because since it used bootstrap to design everything, I had to figure out how to style the modal. So I inspected the page, clicked the modal and I seen how a class would activate as soon as I pressed the button, so i was able to use that class in CSS and style the modal.

##Part 2 - Milestone Reflections
Put your response to the weekly question and a link to your team journal assignment here.


#As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your experiences working with a team to integrate several servers, pages, APIs, and services into one project. Describe how your pieces of the project interfaced with and integrated with your teammates.

My experience with working on this team to implement several servers, pages, api's and services into one project was satisfactory. We were all tasked to do seperate things to finish faster which worked out in the end. And it was nice seeing everything connect in the end.

##As a group, provide links to evidence that:

##Front and back end servers are connected
https://5be4dbe61f12b738826944b3--ratemydiy.netlify.com/

##Users can create accounts and log in through the front end via OAuth
https://ratemydiy-backend.herokuapp.com/

##All APIs and services are connected and can be interacted with through the front end. A test message is acceptable to meet this requirement
